Project 56: Hospital Bed and Resource Allocation System 
Real-world Context: 
Hospitals dynamically allocate beds and resources to patients based on severity and department capacity. 
Detailed Problem Description: 
Implement a resource management system that: 
Stores ward details (ward_id, capacity, occupied_beds, department). 
Stores patient data (name, age, severity, ward_assigned). 
Allocates beds using priority logic (higher severity gets first). 
Uses functions for patient admission/discharge and arrays for ward listing. 
Dynamically manages records using pointers and malloc(). 
Generates reports of occupancy, vacant beds, and department statistics. 
Course Outcomes Covered: 
CO1: Flowchart for patient allocation logic. 
CO2: Implement C constructs for priority checking. 
CO3: Use arrays/functions to manage data. 
CO4: Use pointers for dynamic hospital record management. 
CO5: Build a modular hospital allocation system. 
Syllabus Topics Applied: Problem Solving, Arrays, Loops, Functions, Structures, Pointers, Dynamic Memory.
